      I was looking for professional digital agency that could revamp my existing website and 
      manage it accordingly. A friend strongly recommended codeplab to me and their online reviews 
      looked promising so I went ahead with them. It took them less than 15 days to deliver and 
      the new version looks and works so much better. 
      My website looks great visually and the loading speed has also increased. 
      Their customer support is great. I donâ€™t even have to follow up, 
      they take care of everything by themselves and keep me informed. Highly recommended.`,

      What I like about them? They have a proper "thought process" which really made things easy 
      for both of us to achieve our goal. Communication was platinum level.
      I also wanted them to take over the web design but, the final decision was made by the company owners
      to allocate the job to some other agency they were familiar with. I love the logo they created for us.`,
